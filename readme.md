# Invert your Binance trades with this Chrome Extension
Buys when you sell, sells when you buy - simple. If your day trading sucks, this is the lifehack that will turn you into a literal trading god.

This is a simple chrome extension that, when enabled it will place the opposite trades while on the Spot, Margin on Futures Binance trading.

## How to Use the Binance Invertor extension
1. Download the Repo
2. Navigate to your Chrome Extensions and click "Load Unpacked"
3. Locate the root folder of your extension and open it
4. Once the extension is loaded onto Chrome, go to Binance
5. Navigate to a Spot, Margin or Futures page and refresh just to be sure.
6. Open the extension and click enable

## How to tell whether it has worked
The easiest way to tell whether the inversion worked is to pay attention at the buy and sell buttons as you click "Enable". There will be a very slight horizontal shift.

You can also use the inspect tool in order to highlight the div containing the button and form above it. If the buy form has the "sell-form" id or the other way around you know that it worked.

## Does this strategy work? How was this built?
I'm glad you ask - here's a video I made that covers the build process and testing it for a week's time:
